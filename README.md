The frontend (`client`) is hooked to the backend (`server`) through the proxy set-up in `package.json`.

Run the application by first running the backend:
- go into the server folder by typing the command `cd server` at the root of the folder
- run `python app.py` on the terminal
Then run the frontend to see what's going on:
- `cd client` and run `npm start`

In order to create a new route in the backend, you can look at the existing code.

Please open a PR and request at least 1 reviewer before merging your changes.
