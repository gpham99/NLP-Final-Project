The frontend (`client`) is hooked to the backend (`server`) through the proxy set-up in `package.json`.

Run the application by running the command `npm start` at the root of the folder.

If you want to run the backend only (separate from the frontend), go into the server folder by typing the command `cd server` at the root of the folder and run the command `python app.py` next.

In order to create a new route in the backend, you can look at the existing code.
