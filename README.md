The frontend (`client`) is hooked to the backend (`server`) through the proxy set-up in `package.json`.

Run the application by running the command `npm start` at the root of the folder.

If you want to run the backend only (separate from the fronend), `cd server` and run `python app.py`.

In order to create a new route in the backend, you can look at existing code.
